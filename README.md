# SIP - Session Initiation Protocol

SIP - Learning

# HISTORY:

Analogue
[TIP & Ring Telephony]

Digital 
[Phone System - dedicated ethernet connections]

VoIP
[Shared high speed network, using the same network for internet and phone]
(Cheaper, this is where SIP showed up to provide a solution to this).

The POTS Line (Analogue)

- Analogue
- Plain old Tele service
- Two Wires
- Voltage sends ringing
- Closed Circuit Connects Phones (when both phones are picked up the circuit connects)

ONE of the most reliable ways of communication, even today. 

T1/E1 PRI (Primary Interface)

- Digital
- T1 = 24 Channels
- E1 = 32 Channels
- Contains B Channels (calls) and one Channel D (Signalling - trying to make call, waiting)
- Limited redundancy capabilities

SIP Trunking

- VOIP
- Unlimited Channels, contstrained by Bandwidth
- Delivery over IP Circuits (Internet, Dedicated, MPLS)
- Many redundancy capabilities (flexible, to re-direct keep online)

SIP:

- It changes the playing field, because it was an Open Standard (modern telephony over IP)
- Cisco, tried to do the same thing (to make money out of the open standard)
- SIP, wasn't made for VOIP, it was made to manage the State of a System, but adopted for VoIP

SIP is Versatile

- Calls
- Instant messaging
- Presence
